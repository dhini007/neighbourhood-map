#Neighbourhood Map Project

Read the instructions below to understand how it works..  

## **Instructions**
* Click on the **index.html** file to open the map.
* When you open _index.html_,you will see a **map** consisting of a set of markers for displaying various **landmark locations (or) famous locations** in the neighbourhood.
* Use the **arrow keys** or _drag the mouse while holding left click_ to navigate throughout the map.
* When you click on a marked location (or) a marker, you can see some of the **interesting facts** about that location.
* In the left corner of  the screen, you will see a **menu (or) list** consisting of various marked locations on the map. **Clicking** on a location in the menu will **highlight the respective marker** for you by making the marker associated with it bounce. This will help you identify the location with ease.
* **Scroll** the map to **zoom in or out**.. When you **zoom in** on a particular area, you can take a **closer view of that particular area with more clarity**.
* Also you can make use of the **search box** for searching for a specific landmark.
* Near the search menu, you will see two options namely **map and satellite**.You can use this to _toggle_ between normal map view and satellite view.
* When you _click_ on  **map**, you will see a **checkbox** saying **terrain**.. _Ticking_ it will **highlight all the terrain areas** on the map. _Unticking_ it will take you **back to normal map view**.
* Click on **Satellite** if you want to see a **satellite view** of the map.
* Within Satellite, you will see a _checkbox_ named **labels**.
* It will be **ticked by default**. If you want to see the **complete satellite view of the map without labels**, you can **untick** the checkbox.
* If any **error** occurs saying **Sorry we could not retrieve data from the server at this time. Please try again later**, it means that there are some connectivity issues..Check your network connection. If the problem persists, try again after some time.
* Lastly, if you see the error **Sorry the place you were looking for could not be found on wikipedia**, it means that you have searched for a place that doesnt exist in wikipedia.
